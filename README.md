# International Data Preprocessing

This Python package allows for the normalization of data frames that include international currency or populations. The motivation of this project is to provide a simplified process of normalizing global data so that it is more readable and accessible to the end users. 

## Description

In order to analyze international data, it is necessary to undergo a normalization process. This normalization process allows the end-users to make true comparisons of data values from one specific viewpoint, usually denoted by country and year. This Python package allows end-users to complete this process by passing in a data frame and column type, and executing the intended function. Functionality includes adjusting currency for inflation by comparison year, converting international currency values using exchange rates, and provide per capita metrics using country populations by year. The design focuses on accessibility and ease of use, so that end-users may utilize this tool quickly and effectively. 

## Getting Started

In order to utilize this package, follow the installation instructions below. Ensure the data frame for input contains either currency values or numeric values to align with the required input structure of the package functions. Finally, determine a goal for your given data frame, in order to utilize the correct functions. 

ex: Changing the columns 'Total Millionaires' and 'Country of Origin' columns in my dataframe to 'Millionaires Per Capita' and 'Country of Origin'

## Version History

Coming in 2023: Version 2.0

In January 2023, the international data preprocessing package will receive an update to its master data files in order to reflect the most up to date country populations, currency exchange rates, and inflation rates. This version will be the first of many updates in order to ensure that this package maintains its integrity and accuracy for every end user.
